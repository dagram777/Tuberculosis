# TUBERCULOSIS RESEARCH
This study aims to contribute to the advancement of CAD systems for TB detection by
developing segmentation-based classification approaches that are accurate, robust, and
applicable in practical healthcare settings, with a particular focus on Ethiopian healthcare
systems. The segmentation-based approach targets relevant areas of CXRs, improving the
accuracy of TB diagnosis by excluding irrelevant information. While previous research has
explored DL techniques for automated TB detection, there is a pressing need for highly
accurate and generalizable systems that can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios
for the Ethiopian health care sector. This research endeavors to meet this need, driving
forward the capabilities of CAD systems in the fight against TB.
